GNN-based single-cell gene expression analysis

Using single-cell gene expression analysis frameworks, like [ScanPy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), we can go from single-cell "raw" data in `.h5ad` format to inferring the cells and genes associated with sample/cell metadata, using ML for scientific discovery. 

# Preliminaries

1. To run these analyses, install `pytorch` and `pytorch_geometric` by following these help pages for [torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) and [pyg](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html) installation, respectively.

2. Install `ScanPy`

## quick install

You can `conda` environments and the ```scnd.yml``` file in this repo to install all dependencies
